### 👋 Hi, I'm Ignacio Guzmán
I am a web developer from Argentina 🇦🇷.

I love to learn new things and apply them on the real world.
The utilities and possibilities offered by technology never cease to amaze me.

- 🔭 Currently working on **completing the [2020 front-end developer road map](https://roadmap.sh/frontend)**.
- 🚀 Perfecting myself in **NodeJS, React, Redux**.
- 🌱 Learning about **Docker**.
